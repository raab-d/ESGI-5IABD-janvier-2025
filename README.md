### Labs

Labs are in directory `labs` :

  * one with a README.md with workshop steps and source file to complete
  * a second directory suffixed with `-solution` which contains source file with solutions.
  * Each lab must be submitted in a file named README.pdf containing your answers to all questions, including screenshots if necessary. You must push your submission in a dedicated branch named using the following convention:
